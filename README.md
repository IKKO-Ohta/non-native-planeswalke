## Abstract

Needless to say, for English learners, it isn't fascinating to learn English vocabulary. 
This tool will solve your problem if you are a planeswalker!



 [The BNC/COCA lists are designed primarily for learners of English as a foreign language](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/1857641/about-bnc-coca-vocabulary-list.pdf).

This tool shows the following table.

| BNC/COCA word | Original Cardname | Your language    |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Veto       | Dovin's Veto       | ドビンの拒否権       |
| Verdict     | Supreme Verdict   | 至高の評決       |
| Ultimatum     | Cruel Ultimatum   | 残酷な根本原理      |

Although you can't find each word of BNC/COCA in MTG, it is still helpful to save your time.
